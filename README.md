# Semi Suprevised Machine Learning Approach to predict Respiratory Health Decline, unobtrusively using in-home ambient bed sensor.
This is divided into three main steps:
Data Preprocessing (cleaning and feature engineering) of signal data from Hydraulic Bed Sensor Data
Data Mining of 8-D feature vectors using BIRCH to form a code book.
Build predictive model (using code book from previous step) to make future predictions in older adults living in Americare aging-in-place facilities.

This repository contains the preprocessing (cleaning and feature engineering) of signal data from Hydraulic Bed Sensor Data, data mining and prediction modeling for early respiratory health decline predictions in older adults.
